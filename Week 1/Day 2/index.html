    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;";">Slashers refer to a subgenre of horror films characterized by a psychopathic killer who targets a group of people, usually with some kind of bladed weapon. These movies often include graphic violence, suspenseful sequences, and a high body count.</p>
    <b style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Here are some key characteristics and notable aspects of slasher films:</b>
    <ul style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">
        <li><b>Central Antagonist:</b> The killer is often a masked or concealed figure with a traumatic past or a specific vendetta. This character typically exhibits relentless and almost superhuman strength or resilience.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Weapon of Choice:</b> The killer usually employs a sharp weapon, such as a knife, machete, or axe, which contributes to the visceral nature of the violence.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Final Girl:</b> A common trope in slasher films is the "Final Girl," a female character who survives the ordeal and often confronts the killer in the climax. She is usually portrayed as morally upright and resourceful.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Setting:</b> Slashers often take place in isolated or confined settings, such as summer camps, suburban neighborhoods, or abandoned buildings, enhancing the sense of entrapment and fear.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Teenage Victims:</b> Many slasher films focus on teenagers or young adults as the primary targets, highlighting themes of vulnerability and the consequences of certain behaviors (e.g., promiscuity, drug use).</li>
        <br>
        <li> <b>Jump Scares and Tension:</b> These films rely heavily on building tension and delivering sudden scares to elicit reactions from the audience.</li>
 </ul>
